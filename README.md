# Copper_Tubes_Thermal_Preformance



This project is all about applications of Simple Linear Regression to real data using R.
I used a dataset that contains information regarding the Thermal performance of copper tubes used in refrigeration and process industry.
My project data is taken from a practice problem in William M. Mendenhall & Terry L. Sincichâ€™s textbook, Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences, 6th (2016).
I utilized the textbook, the data set, and the knowledge accumulated though the semester. 
the specific goal is to apply a statistical theory called Simple Linear Regression to the data collected to examine the relationship between the Unflooded Area Ratio and the Heat Transfer Enhancement.
the main objective is to determine if there is a statistical relationship or not between the data.

After examining the data and applying the methods that I learned I got the conclusion that this data has a linear relation, and we can apply Linear Regression on it.
